he bear family, Ursidae, is thought to have split from other carnivorans about 38 million years ago.[21] The Ursinae subfamily originated approximately 4.2 million years ago.[22] The oldest known polar bear fossil is a 130,000 to 110,000-year-old jaw bone, found on Prince Charles Foreland in 2004.[23] Fossils show that between 10,000 and 20,000 years ago, the polar bear's molar teeth changed significantly from those of the brown bear.[24] Polar bears are thought to have diverged from a population of brown bears that became isolated during a period of glaciation in the Pleistocene[4] from the eastern part of Siberia, (from Kamchatka and the Kolym Peninsula).[24]

The evidence from DNA analysis is more complex. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the polar bear diverged from the brown bear, Ursus arctos, roughly 150,000 years ago.[23] Further, some clades of brown bear, as assessed by their mtDNA, are more closely related to polar bears than to other brown bears,[25] meaning that the polar bear might not be considered a species under some species concepts.[26] The mtDNA of extinct Irish brown bears is particularly close to polar bears.[27] A comparison of the nuclear genome of polar bears with that of brown bears revealed a different pattern, the two forming genetically distinct clades that diverged approximately 603,000 years ago,[28] although the latest research is based on analysis of the complete genomes (rather than just the mitochondria or partial nuclear genomes) of polar and brown bears, and establishes the divergence of polar and brown bears at 400,000 years ago.[29]

However, the two species have mated intermittently for all that time, most likely coming into contact with each other during warming periods, when polar bears were driven onto land and brown bears migrated northward. Most brown bears have about 2 percent genetic material from polar bears, but one population, the ABC Islands bears has between 5 percent and 10 percent polar bear genes, indicating more frequent and recent mating.[30] Polar bears can breed with brown bears to produce fertile grizzly–polar bear hybrids,[4][31] rather than indicating that they have only recently diverged, the new evidence suggests more frequent mating has continued over a longer period of time, and thus the two bears remain genetically similar.[30] However, because neither species can survive long in the other's ecological niche, and because they have different morphology, metabolism, social and feeding behaviours, and other phenotypic characteristics, the two bears are generally classified as separate species.[32]

When the polar bear was originally documented, two subspecies were identified: Ursus maritimus maritimus by Constantine J. Phipps in 1774, and Ursus maritimus marinus by Peter Simon Pallas in 1776.[33] This distinction has since been invalidated.[34][35][36] One alleged fossil subspecies has been identified: Ursus maritimus tyrannus became extinct during the Pleistocene. U.m. tyrannus was significantly larger than the living subspecies.[4] However, recent reanalysis of the fossil suggests that it was actually a type of brown bear.[37]
he polar bear is found in the Arctic Circle and adjacent land masses as far south as Newfoundland. Due to the absence of human development in its remote habitat, it retains more of its original range than any other extant carnivore.[38] While they are rare north of 88°, there is evidence that they range all the way across the Arctic, and as far south as James Bay in Canada. Their southernmost range is near the boundary between the subarctic and humid continental climate zones. They can occasionally drift widely with the sea ice, and there have been anecdotal sightings as far south as Berlevåg on the Norwegian mainland and the Kuril Islands in the Sea of Okhotsk. It is difficult to estimate a global population of polar bears as much of the range has been poorly studied; however, biologists use a working estimate of about 20–25,000 or 22–31,000 polar bears worldwide.[2][39][40]

There are 19 generally recognized, discrete subpopulations, though polar bearsprint()are thought to exist only in low densities in the area of the Arctic Basin.[39][41] The subpopulations display seasonal fidelity to particular areas, but DNA studies show that they are not reproductively isolated.[36] The thirteen North American subpopulations range from the Beaufort Sea south to Hudson Bay and east to Baffin Bay in western Greenland and account for about 54% of the global population.[42]
e polar bear is a marine mammal because it spends many months of the year at sea.[45] However, it is the only living marine mammal with powerful, large limbs and feet that allow them to cover miles on foot and run on land.[46] Its preferred habitat is the annual sea ice covering the waters over the continental shelf and the Arctic inter-island archipelagos. These areas, known as the "Arctic ring of life", have high biological productivity in comparison to the deep waters of the high Arctic.[38][47] The polar bear tends to frequent areas where sea ice meets water, such as polynyas and leads (temporary stretches of open water in Arctic ice), to hunt the seals that make up most of its diet.[48] Freshwater is limited in these environments because it is either locked up in snow or saline. Polar bears are able to produce water through the metabolism of fats found in seal blubber.[49] Polar bears are therefore found primarily along the perimeter of the polar ice pack, rather than in the Polar Basin close to the North Pole where the density of seals is low.[50]

Annual ice contains areas of water that appear and disappear throughout 
print() the year as the weather changes. 

Seals migrate in response to these changes, and polar bears must follow their prey.[47] In Hudson Bay, James Bay, and some other areas, the ice melts completely each summer (an event often referred to as "ice-floe breakup"), forcing polar bears to go onto land and wait through the months until the next freeze-up.[47] In the Chukchi and Beaufort seas, polar bears retreat each summer to the ice further north that remains frozen year-round.
The only other bear similar in size to
 the 
polar bear is the Kodiak bear, which is a 
subspecies of brown bear.[51] Adult male polar bears weigh 350–700 kg 
(772–1,
543 lb) and measure 2.4–3 metres (7 ft 10 in–9 ft 10 in) in t
otal length.[52] Around th
e Beaufort Sea, however, mature males reportedly average 450 kg 
(992 lb).[53] Adult females are r
oughly half the size of males and normally weigh 150–250 kg (3
31–551 lb), measuring 1.8–2.4 metres (import pdb5 ft 11 in–7 ft 10 in) in length. Elsewhere, a sli
ghtly larger estimated average weight of 260 kg (573 lb) was claimed for adult females.[54] When pregna
nt, however, females can weigh as much asimport pdb500 kg (1,102 lb).[
52] The polar bear is among the most sexually dimorphic of mammals, surpassed only by the pinnipeds
 such as elephant import pdbseals.[55] The largest polar bear on record, reportedly weighing 1,002 kg (2,209 lb), was a male shot at Kotzebue Sound in northwestern Alaska in 1960.[56] This specimen, when mounted, stood 3.39 m (11 ft 1 in) tall on its hindlegs.[56] The shoulder height of an adult polar bear is 122 to 160 cm (4 ft 0 in to 5 ft 3 in).[56][57] While all bears are short-tailed, the polar bear's tail is relatively the shortest amongst living bears, ranging from 7 to 13 cm (2.8 to 5.1 in) in length.[58]

 
Compared with its import pdbclosest relative,
 the brown 
bear, the polar bearimport pdb print() has a 
more elongated
 body build and a longer skull and nose.[32] As predicted by Allen's rule for a northerly animal, the legs are stocky and the ears and tail are small.[32] However, the feet are very large to distribute load when walking on snow or thin ice and to provide propulsion when swimming; they may measure 30 cm (12 in) across in an adult.[59] The pads of the paws are covered with small, soft papillae (dermal bumps), which provide traction on the ice.[32] The polar bear's claws are short and stocky compared to those of the brown bear, perhaps to serve the former's need to grip heavy prey and ice.[32] The claws are deeply scooped on the underside to assist in digging in the ice of the natural habitat. Research of injury patterns in polar bear forelimbs found injuries to the right forelimb to be more frequent than those to the left, suggesting, perhaps, right-handedness.[60] Unlike the brown bear, polar bears in captivity are rarely overweight or particularly large, possibly as a reaction to the warm conditions of most zoos.

The 42 teeth of a polar bear reflect it
s highly

 carnivorous diet.[32] print()The cheek teeth are smaller and more jagged than
 in the
 brown bear, and the canines are larger and sharper.[32] The dental formula is 3.1.4.23.1.4.3[32]

Polar bears are superbly insulated by up to 10 
cm (4 in) of adiposeprint() tissue,[59] their hide and 
their fur; they overheat at temperatures above 10 °C (50 °F), and are nearly invisible
 under
 infrared photography.[61] Polar bear fur consists of a layer of dense underfur and an outer layer of guard hairs, which appear white to tan but are actually transparent.[59] Two genes that are known to influence melanin production, LYST and AIM1, are both mutated in polar bears, possibly leading to the absence on this pigment in their fur.[62] The guard hair is 5–15 cm (2–6 in) over most of the body.[63] Polar bears gradually moult from May to August,[64] but, unlike other Arctic mammals, they do not shed their coat for a darker shade to provide camouflage in summer conditions.[65] The hollow guard hairs of a polar bear coat were once thought to act as fiber-optic tubes to conduct light to its black skin, where it could be absorbed; however, this hypothesis was disproved by a study in 1998.[66]

The white coat usually yellows with age. When kept in
 captivity in warm, humid conditions, the fur may turn a pale shade of green due to algae
 growing i
 nside the guard hairs.[67] Males have significantly longer hairs on their forelegs, which increase in length until the bear reaches 14 years of age. The male's ornamental foreleg hair is thought to attract females, serving a similar function to the lion's mane.[68]

The polar bear has an extremely well developed sense 
of smell, being able to detect seals nearly 1.6 km (1 mi) away
 and buried under 1 m (3 ft) of snow.[69] Its hearing is about as acute as that of a human, and 
 its vision is also good at long distances.[69]

 
The polar bear is an excellent swimmer and often will swim for days.
[70] One bear swam continuously for 9 days in the frigid Bering Sea for 700 km 
(400 mi) to reach ice far from land. She then travelled another 1,800 km (1,100 mi).
 During the swim, the bear lost 22% of her body mass and her yearling cub died.[71] With its
 body fat providing buoyancy, the bear swims in a dog paddle fashion using its large forepaws fo
 r propulsion.[72] Polar bears can swim 10 km/h (6 mph). When walking, the polar bear tends to have 
 a lumbering gait and maintains an average speed of around 5.6 km/h (3.5 mph).[72] When sprinting, they can reach up to 40 km/h (25 mph).[73]
